## 📜 Problem Statement:

Create a React application that allows a user to input a string of lowercase alphabetic characters. The application should process this string to reorder its characters based on their frequency of occurrence in descending order. The processed string should then be displayed to the user.

You are given a string consisting of lowercase alphabetic characters. Your task is to reorder the characters in the string such that the characters are grouped and sorted based on their frequency of occurrence in descending order. Characters with the same frequency should retain their original order as they first appeared in the string.
